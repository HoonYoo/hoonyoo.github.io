        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>When I worked at a VC in the Bay Area, I had opportunities to work with tech startups. I do not come from a STEM background, and I found it difficult to fully grasp the technical side of the conversations. This is why I started to learn programming. </p>

        <h3>Drums</h3>
        <p> When I was seven years old, I gathered recyclable cans and boxes to create a makeshift drum kit for myself. Soon after, I started imitating the play style of my neighbor, who was a few years older. I also watched Youtube videos to teach myself, joined bands, and convinced my parents so that I could take lessons from an instructor. I have been a drummer since. </p>

        <h3>Freediving</h3>
        <p>What I love about freediving is the serenity under water. To enjoy the tranquility, I have to be calm as well - the more composed you are, the longer time you have under water. </p>
